# Economic-Dispatching

## How to Use

If Python 3 or pip aren't already installed, first go to [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

Now, navigate to cloned folder and install requirements via pip: 

> pip install -r requirements.txt

To start the GUI, navigate to cloned Economic-Dispatching and run gui.py:

> python gui.py

## How to test algorithm

There are 2 scripts related to testing. The first is tests/generate_tests.py. Running it generates 10 random tests in the input folder. Running it will overwrite the old tests.

The 2nd file is test_algorithm.py. You can run it with various flags, which determine the running mode. For example:

> python test_algorithm.py -p -a

runs the active set algorithm on a preset test case. The various flags you can use are:  

-r, -random (test cases run on random tests generated by generate_tests.py)  
-p, -preset (test cases run on a small example test case)  
-a, -active (algorithm of choice is the active set method)
-ls, -squares, -sp (algorithm of choice is scipy minimize, NOTE: No form of Least Squares is used)
